# urbit-doc-links

Simple html file that opens oft-referenced Urbit documentation links in an iframe.

	git clone https://github.com/jfranklin9000/urbit-doc-links

Copy `urbit-doc-links.html` to your hard drive and open it directly from your browser.

GitHub links won't load in an iframe so a (single) tab is opened for those.

It's easy to add your own links by editing `urbit-doc-links.html`.
